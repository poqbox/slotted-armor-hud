# Slotted Armor HUD
An armor HUD for Minecraft!

This mod adds an armor HUD that retains Minecraft's default appearance, without the extra text and numbers.
Also works with resource packs that change the hotbar's appearance.
The parameters of the armor HUD can be adjusted in a [configuration file](./config.md).

This mod is made for [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
If [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is installed, the config can be reloaded in the same way resource packs are.
If [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) is installed,
the mod can be configured using a config screen, accessible through the Mods menu.
